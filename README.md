# 🧱 Olyv

Welcome! This is the official base repository for Olyv-based projects. It's designed to be forked and customized **without modifying the `main` branch**.

## 🛠️ How to Customize This Project

If you've already forked this repository, follow this step to personalize your version:

- Create a `app/` directory at the root and add your code there.  
  Add your own `README.md` inside the `app` directory.

---

This setup allows you to:

- Keep your custom code and documentation separate.
- Safely pull updates from this base project.
- Maintain a clear structure between base and custom logic.

📄 [See `app/README.md`](./app/README.md) for your custom project documentation.

> 💡 Use the `app` folder to add your own code without rewriting the upstream files.
