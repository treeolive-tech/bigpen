# 🚀 Djanx Project Starter

Welcome! This project is designed to be forked and customized **without modifying the `main` branch**.

## 🛠️ How to Customize This Project

If you've already forked this repository, follow these steps to personalize your version:

1. **Create a folder named `.custom`** in the root of your fork.  
   Add your own `README.md` inside `.custom`.

2. To customize the backend:  
   **Create a `custom/` folder inside the `backend/` directory** and add your code there.

3. To customize the web frontend:  
   **Create a `custom/` folder inside the `web/` directory** for your web frontend changes.

---

This structure allows you to keep your own documentation and code separate from the upstream codebase — making it easier to update or sync with future changes.

📄 For more information about this project, [see this](./.custom/README.md).  
*(This should link to the `README.md` you create in your `.custom` folder.)*

> ✅ By using the `.custom/`, `frontend/custom/`, and `backend/custom/` folders, you're extending the project **without rewriting any core code**.
