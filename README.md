   Add your own `README.md` inside `.custom`.

2. To customize the backend:  
   Create a `custom/` folder inside the `backend/` directory and add your code there.

3. To customize the web frontend:  
   Create a `custom/` folder inside the `web/` directory for your web frontend changes.

This setup allows you to:
- Keep your custom code and documentation separate
- Safely pull updates from this base project
- Maintain a clear structure between base and custom logic

📄 [See `.custom/README.md`](./.custom/README.md) for your custom project documentation.

> 💡 Use the `.custom`, `frontend/custom`, and `backend/custom` folders to add your own code without rewriting the upstream files.
